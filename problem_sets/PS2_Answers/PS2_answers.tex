	\section*{Question 1 (40 points): Political Science}
		\vspace{.25cm}
	The following table was created using the data from a study run in a major Latin American city.\footnote{Fried, Lagunes, and Venkataramani (2010). ``Corruption and Inequality at the Crossroad: A Multimethod Study of Bribery and Discrimination in Latin America. \textit{Latin American Research Review}. 45 (1): 76-97.} As part of the experimental treatment in the study, one employee of the research team was chosen to make illegal left turns across traffic to draw the attention of the police officers on shift. Two employee drivers were upper class, two were lower class drivers, and the identity of the driver was randomly assigned per encounter. The researchers were interested in whether officers were more or less likely to solicit a bribe from drivers depending on their class (officers use phrases like, ``We can solve this the easy way'' to draw a bribe). The table below shows the resulting data.

\newpage
\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l | c c c }
		& Not Stopped & Bribe requested & Stopped/given warning \\
		\\[-1.8ex] 
		\hline \\[-1.8ex]
		Upper class & 14 & 6 & 7 \\
		Lower class & 7 & 7 & 1 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item [(a)]
	Calculate the $\chi^2$ test statistic by hand (even better if you can do "by hand" in \texttt{R}).\\
	\vspace{1cm}
	
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=1, lastline=30]{PS2_penny.R} 
	\vspace{.5cm}
	\noindent The chi-squared statistic is 3.791168.
	
	\item [(b)]
	Now calculate the p-value (in \texttt{R}).\footnote{Remember frequency should be $>$ 5 for all cells, but let's calculate the p-value here anyway.}  What do you conclude if $\alpha = .1$?\\
	
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=34, lastline=35]{PS2_penny.R} 
	\vspace{.5cm}
	
\noindent The p-value is 0.1502306. Because the p-value (0.15) is not equal to or below the 0.1 threshold, we do not find sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the variables are statistically independent.
	
\vspace{2cm}
	\item [(c)] Calculate the standardized residuals for each cell and put them in the table below.
	\vspace{1cm}
	
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=39, lastline=93]{PS2_penny.R} 

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l | c c c }
		& Not Stopped & Bribe requested & Stopped/given warning \\
		\\[-1.8ex] 
		\hline \\[-1.8ex]
		Upper class  &0.322  &-1.642  &1.523  \\
		\\
		Lower class &-0.322  &1.642   &-1.523   \\
		
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
	
	\vspace{4cm}
	\item [(d)] How might the standardized residuals help you interpret the results? 
	\vspace{1cm} 
	
\noindent The standardized residuals they tell us how far away our observed result is from the expected result. This is helpful for interpreting our results because we can assess if there are outliers in the data (a data point that is unusually far from the expected value). If an outlier is significantly affecting our regression model, we may need to remove the data point. In this instance, the residuals are not +/- 3 so there does not seem to be any point that is unusually different from the expected value.

\section*{Question 2 (20 points): Economics}
Chattopadhyay and Duflo were interested in whether women promote different policies than men.\footnote{Chattopadhyay and Duflo. (2004). ``Women as Policy Makers: Evidence from a Randomized Policy Experiment in India. \textit{Econometrica}. 72 (5), 1409-1443.} Answering this question with observational data is pretty difficult due to potential confounding problems (e.g. the districts that choose female politicians are likely to systematically differ in other aspects too). Hence, they exploit a randomized policy experiment in India, where since the mid-1990s, $\frac{1}{3}$ of village council heads have been randomly reserved for women. A subset of the data from West Bengal can be found at the following link: \url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kosukeimai/qss/master/PREDICTION/women.csv}\\

\noindent Each observation in the data set represents a village and there are two villages associated with one GP (i.e. a level of government is called "GP"). Figure~\ref{fig:women_desc} below shows the names and descriptions of the variables in the dataset. The authors hypothesize that female politicians are more likely to support policies female voters want. Researchers found that more women complain about the quality of drinking water than men. You need to estimate the effect of the reservation policy on the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities in the villages.

	\includegraphics[width=1.1\textwidth]{../women_desc.png}
\end{figure}		

\newpage
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)] State a null and alternative (two-tailed) hypothesis.
\vspace{1cm}
 
\noindent Null hypothesis: The reservation policy had no effect on the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities in the villages. Alternative hypothesis: The reservation policy had an effect on the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities in the villages.
	
	\vspace{2cm}
	\item [(b)] Run a bivariate regression to test this hypothesis in \texttt{R} (include your code!).
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=96, lastline=118]{PS2_penny.R} 
	\vspace{1cm}
\noindent Beta hat is about 9.252. Alpha hat is about 14.738. The p-value is 0.0197. Because the p-value is less than the 0.05 significance level, we reject the null hypothesis that the reservation policy had no effect on the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities in the villages. 
	
	\vspace{4cm}
	\item [(c)] Interpret the coefficient estimate for reservation policy. 
	\vspace{1cm}
	
\noindent The beta coefficient represents the slope of the regression line. However, because our x-variable is categorical (0 or 1), the beta coefficient is interpreted as there being a 14.738 average increase in the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities in the village since the reserve policy started if the GP was reserved for a woman leader (as opposed to if the GP was not reserved for a woman leader).
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
	\section*{Question 3 (40 points): Biology}

There is a physiological cost of reproduction for fruit flies, such that it reduces the lifespan of female fruit flies.  Is there a similar cost to male fruit flies?  This dataset contains observations from five groups of 25 male fruit flies. The experiment tests if increased reproduction reduces longevity for male fruit flies. The five groups are: males forced to live alone, males assigned to live with one or eight newly pregnant females (non-receptive females), and males assigned to live with one or eight virgin females (interested females). The name of the data set is \texttt{fruitfly.csv}.\footnote{Partridge and Farquhar (1981).``Sexual Activity and the Lifespan of Male Fruitflies''. \textit{Nature}. 294, 580-581.}
	\vspace{1cm}

\begin{tabular}{r|l}
	\texttt{No} & serial number (1-25) within each group of 25\\
	\texttt{type} & Type of experimental assignment \\
	& \hspace{0.1in} $1=$ no females  \\
	& \hspace{0.1in} $2=$ 1 newly pregnant female \\
	& \hspace{0.1in} $3=$ 8 newly pregnant females\\
	& \hspace{0.1in} $4=$ 1 virgin female\\
	& \hspace{0.1in} $5=$ 8 virgin females\\
	\texttt{lifespan} & lifespan (days)\\
	\texttt{thorax} & length of thorax (mm)\\
	\texttt{sleep} & percentage of each day spent sleeping\\
\end{tabular}
	\vspace{1cm}
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item
	Import the data set and obtain summary statistics and examine the distribution of the overall lifespan of the fruitflies.  
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=120, lastline=125]{PS2_penny.R} 
	\begin{figure} [H]
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fly.lifespan.jpeg}
	\end{figure}
\newpage
	\item
	Plot \texttt{lifespan} vs \texttt{thorax}. Does it look like there is a linear relationship? Provide the plot. What is the correlation coefficient between these two variables?
		\vspace{1cm}
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=127, lastline=136]{PS2_penny.R}	
\noindent Yes, it looks like there is a linear relationship. The correlation coefficient is about 0.636.
\begin{figure} [H]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{life.thorax.jpeg}
\end{figure}
		
	\item
	Regress \texttt{lifespan} on \texttt{thorax}.  Interpret the slope of the fitted model.
			\vspace{1cm}
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=138, lastline=156]{PS2_penny.R}
\noindent The slope of the fitted model is beta hat which is 144.3331. This means that for each millimeter (mm) increase in thorax length, there is a 144.3331 increase in lifespan (days).
\vspace{3cm}

	\item
	Test for a significant linear relationship between  \texttt{lifespan} and \texttt{thorax}. Provide and interpret your results of your test.
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=158, lastline=162]{PS2_penny.R}
\noindent The null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between lifespan and thorax. However, our p-value (1.496761e-15) is less than the significance level of 0.05. Thus, we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between lifespan and thorax.
\vspace{1cm}

	\item
	
	Provide the 90\% confidence interval for the slope of the fitted model.
	
			\vspace{.5cm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		Use the formula for typical confidence intervals to find the 90\% confidence interval around the point estimate.		\vspace{.5cm}
		\item
		Now, try using the function  \texttt{confint()}  in \texttt{R}.
	\end{itemize}
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=164, lastline=165]{PS2_penny.R}	
\noindent The 90 percent confidence interval for the slope of the fitted model is (118.196, 170.470). This means that if we took take 100 trials/samples, we would expect 90 of the CIs calculated to contain the true slope and we would expect 10 of the CIs to not include the true slope.
			\vspace{1cm}
			
	\item Use the \texttt{predict()} function in \texttt{R} to (1) predict an individual fruitfly's lifespan when \texttt{thorax}=0.8 and (2) the average \texttt{lifespan} of fruitflies when \texttt{thorax}=0.8 by the fitted model. This requires that you compute prediction and confidence intervals. What are the expected values of lifespan? What are the prediction and confidence intervals around the expected values? 
	
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=167, lastline=174]{PS2_penny.R}
\noindent The expected value of the lifespan for both individual and average is 57.44 days. For an individual, the prediction interval is (22.53736, 92.34264). For the average, the confidence interval is (54.33063, 60.54937).
			\vspace{3cm}
			
	\item	For a sequence of \texttt{thorax} values, draw a plot with their fitted values for \texttt{lifespan}, as well as the prediction intervals and confidence intervals.
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=176, lastline=187]{PS2_penny.R}
\begin{figure} [H]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{preds.jpeg}
\end{figure}
\noindent I chose to analyze observations 30 through 59. The fitted plot is provided above. I was unsure if I should list each prediction and confidence interval because there are 20 different intervals for each of the 20 observations, however, the intervals can be created by running the code.
